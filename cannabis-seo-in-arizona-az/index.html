<h2 class="mt-4" id="1">Legal Status and Regulations Of CBD in Arizona</h2>

                   <p class="mt-3">Arizona has its own unique rules when it comes to cannabis. Here, medical cannabis has been legal since 2010, and recently, adult-use (recreational) cannabis joined the list in 2021. </p>
                  
                   <p>But it's not a free-for-all. There are strict rules about who can buy, sell, and grow cannabis. For instance, you've got to be over 21 to buy recreational cannabis, and there are limits on how much you can have.

                   </p>


                   <h3>Consumer Demographics and Preferences</h3>

<p>They're using it for relaxation, health reasons, and fun. The preference for products varies, too – some love the traditional buds, while others are into edibles or oils.</p>

<p>This info is super important for anyone involved in SEO for Cannabis because it tells you who your audience is and what they like.
